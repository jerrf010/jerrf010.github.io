        <p> <!--Missing start p tag, it won't make the text a paragraph because the browser doesn't know where the element starts-->
            Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth. They are highly intelligent and form
            strong family bonds led by a matriarch. They use their trunks for eating, drinking, and communication.

        <p>There are three main species of elephants — each adapted to its own habitat:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>African Savannah Elephant:</strong> Found in open grasslands.</li>
            <li><strong>African Forest Elephant:</strong> Smaller, lives in dense forests.</li>
            <li><strong>Asian Elephant:</strong> Found across South and Southeast Asia.</li>
        </ul> <!--Should use ul instead of li because it is the ending tag of the list, 
        not the ending of one of the contents in the list-->
        <!--Not defining a list item, so should use /ul to end the unordered list-->
